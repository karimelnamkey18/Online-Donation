                <p>Encourage education among underprivileged kids by replacing their plastics with beautiful bags to carry books and stationery. We plan to distribute these bags in various Government Schools, Kendra Vidyalayas, Pathshalas, and even the kids in slums across the country. There are almost 2 lakh schools in India where children need help with school accessories.</p>
