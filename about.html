            <h1>CLOTHES</h1>
            <p>We live in a consumerism-centric world where ideas like sustainability are still an afterthought. The privileged enjoy possessions, while millions of the poor lack essential clothing. Our mission is to eliminate the lack of clothing among the underprivileged and ensure positive climate action through fabric upcycling.</p>

            <div><h1>Our</h1> <h1>Story</h1>
            <p>Clothes Box Foundation started in 2014 to help the victims lacking relief amenities, with a significant focus on clean clothing.

                With time we realized that millions of people residing in the underdeveloped areas of our country lack access to clean clothing. So, we decided to change that by using the power of social media and connect the haves and have nots.
                
                What started as a conscious thought became a significant turning point for us. As we grew, we received thousands of clothes in donations that were unfit to be used, which led us to establish our in-house recycling facility Refresh.</p>
